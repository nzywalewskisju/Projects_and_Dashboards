## Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to perform **sentiment classification** on tweets about major U.S. airlines.  
Tweets are classified into three categories: **positive, negative, or neutral**.

## Methods
Two neural network models were trained and compared:  
- **LSTM Model** – captures sequential dependencies in text data  
- **CNN Model** – learns local features and patterns within text sequences
- Both models were implemented in Python using standard deep learning frameworks.

## Goals
- Build and evaluate multiple neural network architectures for text classification  
- Compare performance between LSTM and CNN approaches  
- Demonstrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can provide insights into customer sentiment
