## Project Overview
In this university funded project, I developed a Deep Learning Neural Network that has the capability to automatically calculate exit velocities from baseball footage. 

To do so, I curated a custom baseball dataset, labeled it in COCO format, and manually created bounding boxes for movement tracking. Using the YOLO framework, I trained and tested the model, ultimately calculating exit velocities just a few miles per hour off from MLB-provided data.
