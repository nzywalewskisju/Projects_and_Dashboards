# review.py
# Quality gate that evaluates every draft answer before it reaches the user.
# Runs four checks in parallel: grounding, alignment, tone, and applicability.
# Grounding is a hard block on first attempt, non-blocking on retry.
# All other checks are non-blocking warnings. Injects source citations
# into passing answers.

# Functions: run_review_agent, verify_grounding, check_policy_alignment,
#            check_tone, check_advice_applicability, inject_citations
