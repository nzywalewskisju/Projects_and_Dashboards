# Portfolio Projects
Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository highlights projects I’ve worked on in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.  
Each project is organized in its own folder with a detailed README and a Google Colab notebook for interactive exploration.  

## Projects
### [Deep Learning Approach for Calculating Exit Velocity](Deep_Learning_Exit_Velocity/)
- Built a deep learning model to estimate baseball exit velocity using swing and pitch data  
- Includes a [step-by-step project presentation](https://sju.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d507fe15-2cb2-49ee-b3fe-b1e10141282a) and [featured article](https://www.sju.edu/news/how-hawk-scholar-bringing-baseball-analytics-life-ai)  
- [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nzywalewskisju/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Exit_Velocity/Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Calculating_Exit_Velocity.ipynb)

### [Airline Tweets Classification Project](Text_Classification_NN/)
- Trained **two neural networks** (LSTM and CNN) to classify tweets about U.S. airlines  
- Sentiment classification into **positive, negative, or neutral** categories  
- [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nzywalewskisju/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Text_Classification_NN/Airline_Tweets_Classification_Project.ipynb)

### [Predicting Phillies Wins using MLR Model](Predicting_Phillies_Wins/)
- Applied Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict Philadelphia Phillies win totals  
- Identified key performance factors influencing team success  
- [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nzywalewskisju/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Predicting_Phillies_Wins/Predicting_Phillies_Wins_using_MLR_Model.ipynb)
