## Project Overview
This project builds a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict the number of wins for the Philadelphia Phillies.  
The model analyzes historical team performance data and evaluates which factors are most strongly associated with season outcomes.

## Project Goals
- Apply statistical modeling (MLR) to real sports data  
- Identify key variables that influence win totals  
- Demonstrate practical applications of analytics in baseball performance prediction
